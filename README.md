Line Injector
===================

This repository contains the schematics and mechanical files for a line injector. A line can be used to inject a ripple voltage into the supply line of a circuit. This can, for example, be used to measure the [power supply rejection ratio (PSRR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply_rejection_ratio) of a regulator.

Key Features:
 * Bandwidth (-3 dB): 6 Hz - 35 MHz (into 50 Î©)
 * Passband transfer function is about 0.95 V/V (@ 5V) and 0.975 V/V (@ 15V)
 * Maximum input voltage: 50 V
 * Maximum current: 5 A
 * Remote sensing inputs to compensate for the voltage drop over the MOSFET
